# Automatic Segmentation of Calcified Plaque in Carotid Arteries

We introduce a two-step segmentation process. First, segments the carotid artery to narrow the search space and focus on the region of interest around the artery. Then, it segments the calcified plaque within that targeted region. This approach achieves an intersection over union (IoU) of 0.9412 for the 2D model and 0.8095 for the 3D model, outperforming the baseline methods that directly segment plaques.
